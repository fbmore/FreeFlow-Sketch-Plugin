# FreeFlow allows you to quickly:
👉  Copy & Paste Any Layer to Multiple Artboards or Groups
👉  Copy & Paste multiple Symbol Overrides (from Instance to Instance)
👉  Copy & Paste Text values, Size & Position, Colors, Font Family, Opacity and more
👉  Insert an Instance to multiple Artboards or Groups at once (Great for nesting things quickly when building a design system making it much easier to create follow atomic design best practices).


Do lots of things in batches!
👉  Create Symbols, Text & Layer Styles as well as Color Vars given selected layers. 
👉  Rename Text Layers and Text Styles based on their values.

Position things efficiently!
👉  "AutoLayout" (Beta) set spacing between elements or within groups
👉  Position elements based on the distance from right and bottom edges of the parent group or artboard
👉  Smart Sizing & Pinning: Set Selected Layers to Full Width or Height and Auto Pin Them (This is a taste of FreeFlow Autopilot – coming soon) 

Quickly duplicate or generate things from Data!
👉  Duplicate Selected Layers in any Direction: Right, Down, Top and Left
👉  Create Typographic Scales from Selected Text Layer Style and Document Colors
👉  Duplicate Selected Text Layer, Group or Instance with CSV data from Data Symbol 
👉  Populate Selected Instance with CSV data (Generate tables super fast - Beta)  
👉  Populate and update image fills from a source element (great for flows so you don't have to create symbols of entire artboards)

Export things! 
👉  Create a Style Guide of all document Colors, Text & Layer Styles (Beta) (The styleguide includes CSS values) 
👉  Export Selected Artboards as a self-contained SVG Animation (Preview in Browser, export code - Beta)
